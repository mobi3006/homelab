# all base configuration AFTER "install"

# find the configure.sh and run them iteratively
#
# ATTEMPT 1: was not working because if the "configure.sh" is using zsh functions
#            (e. g. contributed via alias.zsh) it fails if the function requires
#            user input (e. g. token)
#
#find ${DOTFILES_ROOT} -name configure.sh | while read configurer ; do source "${configurer}" ; done

# ATTEMPT 2: manual approach
#echo "manually execute these commands/functions:"
#echo "=========================================="
#find ${DOTFILES_ROOT} -name configure.txt | xargs cat
